# FurcodeJS
Improving Furcode by @oklomsy except in Javascript.

## A little help on how to use furcode
First things first, you will need to import this javascript into your HTML project.

Then, these are the original commands:

"In furcode there are only two commands.

owo and uwu.

owo is the print command

uwu is for comparing two values and printing something"

But there is now uwuEval. uwuEval is like uwu except it executes code after it finds something equal.

Also, there's fursuit and fursuitEval, fursuit is the opposite of uwu. Where uwu checks for equality, this checks for inequality.
